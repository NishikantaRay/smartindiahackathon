Background: Currently in AICTE Event/Activity Management happens manually. 
Such examples of activities that happen manually are Booking of meeting room/auditorium, communication to all the bureaus/members regarding meetings through email and SMS alerts, intimate canteen for refreshment/Lunch/dinner arrangements, update the information on AICTE social media like Facebook & Twitter page, Report generation, activity log checking etc. 
This manual process generally takes a lot of time to implement and can cause delay to the actual work. 
With the fast growing network of AICTE, it needs to automate its process to provide ease to manual work. 
This can highly increase in economic growth of AICTE and manage all events very smoothly with all information to have directed to one single portal. 

Summary: Due to manually management of Events AICTE faces a lot of challenges where they lose a lot of time to gather all the events together. 
Create a common portal for all AICTE Event/Activity management would ease you their work and make the work process robust and flexible. 
This will ensure AICTE to have all events under one umbrella from where the management would be easy and confortable. 

Objective: : 

We need you to create a portal where using this system organizing Bureau/cell will initiate the event by deciding on the following point: 
• List of various committees (including members) 
• List of involved Bureaus or cells 
• Role and responsibilities of all concerned members and committees. 

Required features in the portal would be as follows 
• Booking of meeting room/auditorium - Room Requistion System / Prevent Overlap of bookings.
• Communication to all the bureaus/members regarding meetings through email and SMS alerts /- mail them, sms twilio. 
• A separate interface to intimate canteen for refreshment/Lunch/dinner arrangements  // realtime update page // or // Send SMS/Email to canteen head //, admin send notification food count, food type north south east west, lunch/dinner/refreshments 
• An interface of this system to update the information on AICTE social media like Facebook & Twitter page. FB/Twitter API use to add posts   
• Report Generation Statistics - Total Rooms booked, food served, members in commiteee stats, 
• Activity Log - Logins / Books / Cancelled / Food Requests / Events conducted
• Dashboard - EVents Board / Signup Page / Admin Login / Canteen Login
